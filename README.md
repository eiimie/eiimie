Hi! I'm eiimie. I'm an aspiring game designer. 

I'm currently learning Java and C++, but I can also code in C#, Python, HTML, and CSS.

Current projects include... 
- <b> Less AI, Please! </b> An extension that automatically adds "-ai" to the ends of Google searches, which minimises the amount of AI generated images in Google searches. Useful for artists or anybody who needs to use accurate references - or just doesn't want to see AI for any reason. 
- <b> Nothing Ever Happens. </b> A mod for <i>Hearts of Iron IV</i>, <i>Stellaris</i>, and <i>Crusader Kings III</i>, which will stop any wars from happening and immediately end any wars that do happen. Because, of course, Nothing Ever Happens!
- <b> Fantasiki. </b> A programme for fantasy writers that allows them to create offline, internal wikipedias for their worlds. Very handy for worldbuilders.

I'm also a freelance graphic designer, with experience in brand and logo design. When I have time, I'll link my portfolio here!
