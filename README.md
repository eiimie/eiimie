Hi! I'm eiimie. I'm an aspiring game designer, artist, and writer. 

I'm currently learning Java and C++, but I can also code in C#, Python, HTML, and CSS. (And a bit of Javascript, too.)

Current projects include... 
- <b> Less AI, Please! </b> A chrome web extension that minimises the amount of AI generated images in Google searches. Useful for artists or anybody who needs to use accurate references - or just doesn't want to see AI results for any reason. <a href="https://github.com/eiimie/lessAIplease/tree/main">Check it out here!</a>
- <b> Fantasiki. </b> A programme for fantasy writers that allows them to create offline, internal wikipedias for their worlds. Very handy for worldbuilders.
- <b> Bo3 (Bookmark Of Our Own). </b> A chrome web extension that will keep track of your ten most recent reads on Archive Of Our Own and track your place. Once you finish a fic, it will be removed automatically. Acts as a bookmark! 

<b>Fun fact about me...</b>
I'm currently learning Japanese and Polish!　初めまして！
